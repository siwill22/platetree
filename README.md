# platetree
code for creating map visualisations of GPlates rotation model hierarchies

The code in this repo is designed to make link between the hierarchy in a GPlates rotation model and a 
set of geometries in a gplates-readable set of geometries, so that the plate hierarchy can be 
visualised on a map with line geometries linking the plates that are connected in the hierarchy.
